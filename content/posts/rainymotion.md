## Quick description

`rainymotion` is a Python library for radar-based precipitation nowcasting based on optical flow techniques. The main idea is to provide a stack of open models which can serve as a transparent benchmark for further development of nowcasting techniques. An extensive verification study in Germany has shown that the `rainymotion` models based on Dense optical flow are at least equivalent if not superior to state-of-the-art operational nowcasting techniques.
